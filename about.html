        <h1 class="textbox__heading">About me</h1>
         <p class="textbox__paragraphs__aboutme">My name is Joachim, i am 25 years old and studying
            in Odense to become a multimediadesigner. 
            I have a big passion for creative projects and  i
            love a good challenge where you need to give your everything.</p> 
            
         <p class="textbox__paragraphs__aboutme">   I have worked with creative
            projects since the age of 12, when i first got my hands
            on moviemaker, although what i made is now lost
            media. in 2014 started producing edm music and in 2016 
            make music “visualisers” on youtube.</p>
            
         <p class="textbox__paragraphs__aboutme">When i am not deep in coding or one of the 
            design tools, i love to watch formula 1 and football,
            hang out with friends or just chill out on the couch
            playing some playstation. Like mentioned before, i 
            also produce edm music under the artist name 
            Martin Lübeck.</p>
        


        <h1 class="textbox__heading">My goals</h1>
        <p class="textbox__paragraphs__aboutme">Its always healthy to have ambitious career wishes. I dream 
            about being a part of the “maang-soup” which is the inside
            joke about Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.</p> 
            
        <p class="textbox__paragraphs__aboutme">I love the work enviroment, and there are videoes on youtube
            that shows the days in the life of a developer. although i know
            they are very romanticised, and the job itself will be very
            tough, i still feel like i belong there. I have friends who became
            senior developers at some of the big clothing e-shops here
            in Denmark, they are both my mentors and my inspiration.</p>
            
        <p class="textbox__paragraphs__aboutme">I love frontend coding, and i already am coding concepts for
            small businesses around town. Although its just passion 
            projects and not real clients. 
            
            If i want to progress down the line, i could see myself as a
            full stack developer 
            </p>
        
        <h1 class="textbox__heading">My abilities</h1>
        <p class="textbox__paragraphs__aboutme">As a multimediadesigner, i can help with your projects on a number of differnet branches and areas. I can do html and css coding, i can create
            content like commercial shoots and product pictures or help your team with research, where i both do quality and quantity reserach. You just tell me where you need my assistance
            and i will happily look into it.
