        <h1 class="textbox__heading">About me</h1>
         <p class="textbox__paragraphs">My name is Joachim, i am 25 years old and studying
            in Odense to become a multimediadesigner. 
            I have a big passion for creative projects and  i
            love a good challenge. I have worked with creative
            projects since the age of 12, when i first got my hands
            on moviemaker, although what i made is now lost
            media. in 2014 started producing edm music and later 
            make music “visualisers” on youtube.
            Take a look
            
            When i am not deep in coding or one of the 
            design tools, i love to watch formula 1 and football,
            hang out with friends or just chill out on the couch
            playing some playstation. Like mentioned before, i 
            also produce edm music under the artist name 
            Martin Lübeck.</p>
        


        <h1 class="textbox__heading">My goals</h1>
        <p class="textbox__paragraphs">Its always healthy to have ambitious career wishes. I dream 
            about being a part of the “maang-soup” which is the inside
            joke about Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. 
            
            I love the work enviroment, and there are videoes on youtube
            that shows the days in the life of a developer. although i know
            they are very romanticised, and that the job itself will be very
            tough, i still feel like i belong there. I have friends who became
            senior developers at some of the big clothing e shops here
            in Denmark, they are both my mentors and my inspiration.
            
            I love frontend coding, and i already am coding concepts for
            small businesses around town. Although its just passion 
            projects and not real clients. 
            
            If i want to progress down the line, i could see myself as a
            full stack developer
